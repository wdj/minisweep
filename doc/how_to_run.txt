Running the sweep miniapp
-------------------------

Usage
-----

./sweep [ --<setting_name> <setting_value> ] ...

aprun [ <aprun_arg> ] ... sweep [ --<setting_name> <setting_value> ] ...

Settings
--------

--ncell_x

  The global number of gridcells along the X dimension.

--ncell_y

  The global number of gridcells along the Y dimension.

--ncell_z

  The global number of gridcells along the Z dimension.

--ne

  The total number of energy groups.  For realistic simulations may
  range from 1 (small) to 44 (normal) to hundreds (not typical).

--na

  The number of angles for each octant direction.  For realistic simulations
  a typical number would be up to 32 or more.

  NOTE: the number of moments is specified as a compile-time value, NM.
  Typical values are 1, 4, 16 and 36.

  NOTE: for CUDA builds, the angle and moment axes are always fully threaded.

--niterations

  The number of sweep iterations to perform.  A setting of 1 iteration
  is sufficient to demonstrate the performance characteristics of the
  code.

--nproc_x

  Available for MPI builds. The number of MPI ranks used to decompose
  along the X dimension.

--nproc_y

  Available for MPI builds. The number of MPI ranks used to decompose
  along the Y dimension.

--nblock_z

  The number of sweep blocks used to tile the Z dimension.  Currently must
  divide ncell_z exactly.  Blocks along the Z dimension are kept on
  the same MPI rank.
  The algorithm is a wavefront algorithm, where every block is
  considered as a node of the wavefront grid for the wavefront calculation.

  NOTE: when nthread_octant==8, setting nblock_z such that nblock_z % 2 == 0
  can considerably increase performance.

--is_using_device

  Available for CUDA builds.  Set to 1 to use the GPU, 0 for
  CPU-only (default).

--is_face_comm_async

  For MPI builds, 1 to use asynchronous communication (default),
  0 for synchronous only.

--nthread_octant

  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, the number of threads deployed to octants.
  The total number of threads equals the product of all thread counts
  along problem axes.
  Can be 1, 2, 4 or 8.
  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, should be set to 8.  Otherwise should be
  set to 1 (default).
  Currently uses a semiblock tiling method for threading octants,
  different from the production code.

--nsemiblock

  An experimental tuning parameter.  By default equals nthread_octant.

--nthread_e

  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, the number of threads deployed to energy groups
  (default 1).
  The total number of threads equals the product of all thread counts
  along problem axes.

--nthread_y

  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, the number of threads deployed to the Y axis
  within a sweep block (default 1).
  The total number of threads equals the product of all thread counts
  along problem axes.
  For CUDA builds, can be set to a small integer between 1 and 4.
  Not advised for OpenMP builds, as the parallelism is generally too
  fine-grained to give good performance.

--nthread_z

  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, the number of threads deployed to the Z axis
  within a sweep block (default 1).
  The total number of threads equals the product of all thread counts
  along problem axes.
  Since the sweep block thickness in Z (ncell_z/nblock_z) commonly equals 1,
  this setting should generally be set to 1.
  Not advised for OpenMP builds, as the parallelism is generally too
  fine-grained to give good performance.

--ncell_x_per_subblock

  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, a blocking factor for blocking the sweep block
  to deploy Y/Z threading.  By default equals the number of cells along the
  X dimension for the given MPI rank, or half this amount if the axis
  is semiblocked due to octant threading.

--ncell_y_per_subblock

  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, a blocking factor for blocking the sweep block
  to deploy Y/Z threading.  By default equals the number of cells along the
  Y dimension for the given MPI rank, or half this amount if the axis
  is semiblocked due to octant threading.

--ncell_z_per_subblock

  For OpenMP or CUDA builds, a blocking factor for blocking the sweep block
  to deploy Y/Z threading.  By default equals the number of cells along the
  Z dimension for the given MPI rank, or half this amount if the axis
  is semiblocked due to octant threading.
  Since the sweep block thickness in Z (ncell_z/nblock_z) commonly equals 1,
  this setting should generally be set to 1.
